Class description:
    This class is contains four static methods that perform arithmetic
    computations based on the single argument that is parsed to as a paramter to
    method call. The purpose this class serves is completely educational has the aim 
    to help student grasp meaning of writing documentation/description of the class/method

'ComputeFirst' method description:
        This method takes an argument of type float and performs following computations:
        y=x^4*4.769+x^3*4.159-x^2*2.745+x*4.503
        value of an rgument should be in range of(-inf,2.853] and [88.069, +inf)

'ComputeSecond' description:
        This method takes an argument of type float and performs following computations:
        y=x^3*2.027-x^2*2.578+x*6.966
        value of an rgument should be in range of(-inf,2.853] and [88.069, +inf)
 
'ComputeThird' method description:
        This method takes an argument of type float and performs following computations:
        y=x^2*1.575+x*3.894
        value of an rgument should be in range of(-inf,2.853] and [88.069, +inf)
 
'ComputeFourth' method description:
        This method takes an argument of type float and performs following computations:
        y=x*2.644
        value of an rgument should be in range of(-inf,2.853] and [88.069, +inf)
